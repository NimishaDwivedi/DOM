/* 3. Model (M): Represents the data and business logic of the application. It manages the data, performs operations on it, and notifies the views of any changes.
Responsibilities: Data manipulation, validation, and interaction with the database. It does not directly interact with the user interface.
View (V): Represents the user interface and displays information to the user. It receives input from the user and sends it to the controller for processing.
Responsibilities: Presentation of data, rendering user interface elements, and capturing user input. It does not handle business logic or data manipulation.
Controller (C): Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It receives user input from the view, processes it (often involving interactions with the model), and updates the view accordingly.
Responsibilities: Handling user input, invoking business logic in the model, updating the view based on changes in the model. It orchestrates the flow of data between the model and the view.
In summary, the Model is responsible for managing data and business logic, the View is responsible for displaying information to the user, and the Controller handles user input, processes it, and updates the model and view accordingly. This separation of concerns promotes modularity, maintainability, and scalability in software development. */
